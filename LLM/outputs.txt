Grass is green because of a pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps plants absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, which is the process they use to make food. It reflects green light, which is why we see grass as green. Other colors of light are absorbed for energy, but the green light is not absorbed as much, so it bounces back to our eyes.
